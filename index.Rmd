**Knowledge shared is knowledge squared**

We live in a world with huge information-flow and with new knowledge constantly introduced to the scientific community. Sometimes all these new information can be overwhelming and difficult to gasp - especially if you are new in the field. However, knowledge can be shared on several levels of complexity. We need to focus on appropriate and new ways to disseminate the knowledge that we gain, so that our research and finding reach a broader audience. With these entries I aim to provide knowledge sharing in an simple and introducing manner. The entries serve to introduce and discuss topics, concepts and exciting papers from the field of biostatistics and epidemiology and give the reader a base and a interest to further investigate the subjects. Whether you are from the field of biostatistics and epidemiology or just a curious reader, I hope that these entries will help you understand the basic concepts and the research that the we do in this field.

Thank you for reading!
